This is a 42 school project to create a game player. It is a basic algorithm project. The principle is simple: two players compete on a board, and must place, in turn, the piece that the master of the game (provided in the form of a Ruby executable) gives them, thus earning points. The game stops as soon as a piece can no longer be placed. Little fun project!
